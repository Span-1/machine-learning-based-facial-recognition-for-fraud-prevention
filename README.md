Real-Time Face Recognition with Anti-Spoofing

A fraud prevention system that uses computer vision and deep learning to detect and verify human faces in real-time. The system prevents spoofing attempts (e.g., photos, videos, masks) by validating live presence through blink/head movement detection.

âœ¨ Features

Real-time webcam-based face recognition

Human detection using YOLO (Ultralytics)

Automatic dataset generation for training

Face recognition using a CNN (Keras + TensorFlow)

Liveness detection to prevent spoofing

Speech-to-text & text-to-speech integration

Local logging of authentication events
